    "intro": "I‚Äôm a <b>Systems and Computing Engineer</b> with a strong foundation in visualization, interaction, and creative technology. My academic path in <b>Visual Computing</b> ‚Äîcovering areas such as visual analytics, augmented reality (Vuforia), and 3D interaction (Unity, WebGL, Oculus)‚Äîshaped my focus on how people <i>see</i> and <i>feel</i> technology, transforming data, motion, and interaction into meaningful digital experiences. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve combined technologies like <b>React, Unity, Three.js, Node.js</b>, and <b>C++</b> to craft interfaces where creativity meets precision.",
    "experience": "Since joining adidas, this global enterprise has strengthened my focus on <b>quality, reliability</b>, and teamwork across cultures. Beyond development, I‚Äôm deeply drawn to sharing knowledge‚ÄîI love teaching, mentoring, and helping others grow in their technical and creative journeys. Having worked and lived across different cultures‚Äîfrom my beloved <b>Bogot√°, Colombia</b>, to my dream come true in <b>Berlin, Germany</b>‚ÄîI‚Äôve learned that curiosity and adaptability are my greatest tools. Whether I‚Äôm writing code or traveling the world, I‚Äôm driven by the same goal: <b>to connect people through technology.</b>",
